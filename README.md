# Data-Challenge-Telecom-Paris
Data Challenge 2023 for the Post Master Big Data and Artificial Intelligence at Telecom Paris, where I won first place.

## Description
The data set was provided by IDEMIA, a multinational security company with headquaters in France. It consists of images of faces of different persons with certain characteristics. 

The task was to train a model able to predict whether certain images possess required chacteristics (encoded by the output labels) or not.
